# Week 2 — ETL & Exploratory Analysis Project

## Overview

This repository implements a reproducible ETL pipeline and exploratory data analysis (EDA) workflow for e-commerce data.  
Raw CSV files are ingested, cleaned, and transformed into optimized Parquet datasets, followed by analytical summaries and visual reporting.

The project is structured to be modular, maintainable, and easy to extend for future analyses or additional data sources.
