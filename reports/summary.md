## Key Findings
- The distribution of transaction values is uneven, with higher amounts occurring less frequently. Limiting extreme values through winsorization helped produce more robust summary statistics.
- Order activity is heavily concentrated in Saudi Arabia, while the UAE contributes a smaller share, suggesting that demand is primarily driven by the Saudi market.
- The number of orders per day remains consistent overall, with no unusual surges observed during the analyzed period.
